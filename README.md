# VR Forklift â€“ Industrial Training Simulation

**VR Forklift** is a fully immersive warehouse training simulation built in Unity, focused on realistic forklift operation, safety protocols, and task-based learning. Designed using the Unity XR Toolkit, the experience allows players to operate a forklift in dynamic, industrial environments while developing practical skills through guided tasks and feedback.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- **Realistic Forklift Operation**  
  Physics-based driving and cargo handling designed for immersive VR training.

- **Step-by-Step Industrial Procedures**  
  Includes forklift startup, cargo transport, safety compliance, and guided mission flow.

- **Visual Prompts and Task Guidance**  
  Waypoint systems provide visual cues for users to complete tasks efficiently.

- **Performance Tracking**  
  Tracks player accuracy, task time, and adherence to safety protocols.

- **Clean Code Architecture**  
  Developed using partial SOLID principles for scalability and maintainability.
